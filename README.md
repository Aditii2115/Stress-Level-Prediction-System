Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting an individual’s stress level using machine learning techniques and Python programming concepts. The system analyzes lifestyle and behavioral factors such as sleep duration, physical activity, screen time, work hours, caffeine intake, and social interaction to classify stress levels as Low, Medium, or High. 
The project demonstrates a complete data-science workflow, combining Python fundamentals, data analysis, and machine learning models to generate meaningful insights. 

Features

- Dataset preprocessing and cleaning
- Categorical data encoding
- Machine learning model comparison
- Stress prediction from user input
- Data visualization using bar charts
- Object-oriented model implementation
- Exception handling for file operations

Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Machine Learning Models

The following models were implemented and compared:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest 

The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy (~0.70) and was selected as the best model for prediction.

Workflow

- The project follows these steps:
- Load dataset using Pandas with exception handling
- Clean and preprocess data
- Encode categorical variables
- Perform exploratory numerical analysis using NumPy
- Train multiple machine learning models
- Compare model accuracy
- Visualize results
- Predict stress level using user input
